# cloud-run-cicd-template
This repository should contain all required files to setup a Cloud Run service using Cloud Build for CI/CD.

TODO:
1. Update "cloudbuild.json" file with the Cloud Run service name.
2. Add dependencies to "Dockerfile".
3. Update this "README.md" file!
4. Authentication is handled by the check_auth function. Do not forget to save authentication credentials for this service in Google Cloud Secret! See check_auth function docstring for details (including selecting the Cloud Secret name).
